## Introduction ##
RoadMate is a social networking site designed to help users organise and manage [carpooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpooling) within [New Zealand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand).

## Development ##
RoadMate was developed as a 3<sup>rd</sup> year software engineering project at Massey University.

Due to resource constraints RoadMate developed as a **proof-of-concept** as opposed to a full blown system. It was seen as an opportunity to practice some of the theory taught over the previous years.
